# EventsCalendar
**This is a Python program that prints a Sunday to Saturday calendar of events based on a user-provided date between the years 1000 AD and 9999 AD.**
To run the program:
1. Clone the repository with all files
2. Open the file "main_calendar.py"
3. Compile and run this file as the main script
4. When prompted, enter a date in the form "mm-dd-yyyy" or "m-d-yyyy"*
5. The program will print the week of the provided date and any events that occurred on that date

_*Valid dates have a 4 digit year and occur between 1000 AD and 9999 AD_

Running the test file "eventcalendar_test.py" will print nothing if no errors occur.
